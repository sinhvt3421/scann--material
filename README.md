# Introduction
This repository is the official implementation of [Deep learning reveals where to pay attention to for interpreting the structure-property relationship of materials](https://).

We developed an attention-based model that takes advantage of a neural network to quantitatively capture
the contribution of the local structure of material properties.

The model captures information on atomic sites
and their local environments by considering self-consistent long-range interactions to enrich the structural
representations of the materials. A comparative experiment was performed on benchmark dataset QM9 to compare
the performance of the proposed model with state-of-the-art representations in terms of prediction accuracy
for several target properties. The experimental comparison confirmed that the proposed model could predict
several target properties of molecular and crystalline materials with reasonably high accuracy.

Furthermore,
the quantitative contribution of each local structure to the properties of the materials can help understand
the structural-property relationships of the materials.

# GAMNet framework

The Global Attention model Network (GAMNet) is an implementation of deep attention mechanism for materials science

Figure 1 shows the overall schematic of the model

# Usage

Our current implementation supports a variety of use cases for users with
different requirements and experience with deep learning. Please also visit
the [notebooks directory](notebooks) for Jupyter notebooks with more detailed code examples.

## Using pre-built models

In our work, we have already built models for the QM9 data set. The model is provided as serialized HDF5+JSON files. 

* QM9 molecule data:
  * HOMO: Highest occupied molecular orbital energy
  * LUMO: Lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy
  * Gap: energy gap
  * ZPVE: zero point vibrational energy
  * Î±: isotropic polarizability
  * Cv: heat capacity at 298 K

The MAEs on the various models are given below:

# Datasets

## Experiments

The code for experiments specific is placed in the folder [configs] (<https://github.com/sinhvt3421/material-dl/tree/master/configs>)

We provide an implementation for the QM9 experiments, the Fullerence-MD, the Pt/graphene-MD and SmFe12-MD experiments

## Basic usage
